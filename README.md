#### But Discord Warsim is a bot, why does it need a docker file or container at all?
Due to the way Discord Warsim will be hosted, it will require a docker container, and of course to get the container you will need the docker file.
Also, incase anyone makes a varient or something the dockerfile is written so that you could use it for the varient without any modifications to the docker container or dockerfile.
